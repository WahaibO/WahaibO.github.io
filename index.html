				<h2>Games</h2>
				<p>I really enjoy playing games specifically fighting games, shooters, open world, and adventure. My favorite game of
					all time is super smash brothers. Smash bros is a game i grew up with since I was very young and it was the first game
					I ever played and im still playing it to this day competitively and casually with friends and family. The character you see above is Cloud strife, hes my favorite video game character of all time.</p>

					<h2>Why I entered this fellowship</h2>
					<p>Like i said before i love tech and thats one of the main reasons i entered this fellowship. The other reason i joined this fellowship is because i wanted to get into coding because coding or computer science is the only subject that seems enjoyable in college. I joined the fellowship thinking that this is robotics coding but i realized that its web coding when i was reading about the fellowship but in these days i actually enjoyed web coding alot and started to get more and more interested everyday.</p>
